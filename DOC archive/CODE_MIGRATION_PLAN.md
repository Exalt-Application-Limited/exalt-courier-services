# Courier Services Code Migration Plan
*Date: May 25, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating code from the secondary development directory to the main courier services directory to complete missing components. This is a critical operation that must be performed with extreme care to maintain code integrity.

## Source and Destination Directories

**Source Directory:**
```
C:\Users\frich\Desktop\Micro-Social-Ecommerce-Ecosystems\ALL DOCS\Courier-Doc
```

**Destination Directory:**
```
C:\Users\frich\Desktop\Micro-Social-Ecommerce-Ecosystems\social-ecommerce-ecosystem\courier-services
```

## Component Mapping

| Source Component | Destination Component | Notes | Status |
|------------------|------------------------|-------|--------|
| courier-services/corporate-branch | courier-services/branch-courier-app | Fully implemented version of the Branch Courier App | Pending |
| courier-services/field-staff-mobile | courier-services/driver-mobile-app | Same component with different naming convention | Pending |
| courier-services/customer-mobile-app | courier-services/user-mobile-app | May require name adaptation | Pending |
| courier-services/hq-admin | courier-services/global-hq-admin | Administrative interface | Pending |
| courier-services/third-party-integration-service | courier-services/third-party-integration | Integration service with external providers | Pending |
| courier-services/domain-model | courier-services/courier-shared | Shared domain models | Pending |
| courier-services/shared-config | courier-services/courier-shared | Configuration to be merged into shared component | Pending |
| courier-services/performance-testing | N/A - Create new | Should be preserved as a new component | Pending |
| courier-services/routing-service | courier-services/routing-service | May need to merge with existing component | Pending |

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (Pre-Migration)

1. **Create Full Backups**
   - [ ] Backup source directory
   - [ ] Backup destination directory

2. **Detailed Component Analysis**
   - [ ] Compare component structures
   - [ ] Identify specific files to be migrated
   - [ ] Document package naming differences
   - [ ] Verify build file compatibility (pom.xml)

### Phase 2: Component Migration

#### 1. corporate-branch → branch-courier-app
- [ ] Create/verify destination directory structure
- [ ] Migrate source code (Java files)
- [ ] Migrate resources
- [ ] Update package names if necessary
- [ ] Migrate configuration files
- [ ] Validate build files
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 2. field-staff-mobile → driver-mobile-app
- [ ] Compare existing content to avoid overwriting
- [ ] Identify unique components to migrate
- [ ] Merge source code carefully
- [ ] Update package references
- [ ] Validate combined implementation
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 3. customer-mobile-app → user-mobile-app
- [ ] Create/verify destination directory structure
- [ ] Migrate source code
- [ ] Update package references
- [ ] Migrate configuration
- [ ] Validate build files
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 4. hq-admin → global-hq-admin
- [ ] Create/verify destination directory structure
- [ ] Migrate source code
- [ ] Update package references
- [ ] Migrate configuration
- [ ] Validate build files
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 5. third-party-integration-service → third-party-integration
- [ ] Compare existing content
- [ ] Merge or replace as appropriate
- [ ] Update package references
- [ ] Validate build files
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 6. domain-model & shared-config → courier-shared
- [ ] Analyze existing courier-shared content
- [ ] Merge domain models
- [ ] Merge configurations
- [ ] Resolve any conflicts
- [ ] Update references in other components
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 7. routing-service → routing-service
- [ ] Compare existing implementation
- [ ] Identify gaps and improvements
- [ ] Selectively merge code
- [ ] Preserve existing functionality
- [ ] Validate build files
- [ ] Compile to verify integrity

#### 8. performance-testing → new component
- [ ] Create new directory in destination
- [ ] Migrate testing code
- [ ] Update references
- [ ] Validate setup

### Phase 3: Validation and Integration

1. **Component-Level Validation**
   - [ ] Compile each migrated component individually
   - [ ] Run unit tests for each component
   - [ ] Fix any compilation or test failures

2. **Integration Validation**
   - [ ] Verify cross-component references
   - [ ] Test integration points between components
   - [ ] Validate with existing dependent services

3. **Documentation Update**
   - [ ] Update README files for each component
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Update the domain audit report to reflect completed status

### Phase 4: Final Verification

1. **Full System Compilation**
   - [ ] Compile entire courier services domain
   - [ ] Resolve any final issues

2. **Migration Cleanup**
   - [ ] Remove temporary files
   - [ ] Organize any remaining elements

## Migration Tracking Table

| Component | Files to Migrate | Files Count | Dependencies | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| corporate-branch | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | |
| field-staff-mobile | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | Merge with driver-mobile-app |
| customer-mobile-app | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | Adapt to user-mobile-app |
| hq-admin | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | |
| third-party-integration-service | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | |
| domain-model | Java sources | ? | None | Not Started | Merge with courier-shared |
| shared-config | Config files | ? | None | Not Started | Merge with courier-shared |
| routing-service | Java sources, configs, tests | ? | courier-shared | Not Started | Compare with existing |
| performance-testing | Test scripts, configs | ? | None | Not Started | Create new component |

## Questions and Clarifications

1. Should we maintain different package naming conventions between source and destination?
2. How should we handle potential conflicts in shared libraries?
3. Are there any specific API or interface changes to be aware of?
4. Should we update version numbers in migrated components?

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Source code lost during transfer | Low | High | Create comprehensive backups before starting |
| Compilation errors after migration | Medium | High | Validate each component individually before integration |
| Package naming conflicts | Medium | Medium | Carefully update import statements and references |
| Dependency version conflicts | Medium | Medium | Analyze and align dependency versions |
| Integration failures | Medium | High | Test integration points thoroughly |

*This plan will be updated throughout the migration process to track progress and address any issues that arise.*
