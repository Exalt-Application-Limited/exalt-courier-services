# GitHub Repository Preparation Guide

This document provides guidance for completing Phase 5 of the courier services migration: GitHub Repository Preparation.

## Overview

Phase 5 involves setting up the GitHub repository structure, CI/CD pipeline, and branch protection for the migrated courier services within the Driver Mobile App.

## Prerequisites ✅

All prerequisites have been completed:
- ✅ All code components migrated and tested
- ✅ Configuration files verified and complete
- ✅ Documentation updated and comprehensive
- ✅ Integration tests implemented and working
- ✅ Unit tests passing

## Phase 5 Tasks

### 1. Repository Structure Setup

#### Required Actions:
- [ ] Create or verify GitHub repository under `Micro-Services-Social-Ecommerce-App` organization
- [ ] Set up proper directory structure following microservices pattern
- [ ] Configure repository description and topics
- [ ] Set up initial branch structure

#### Repository Structure:
```
driver-mobile-app/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/          # CI/CD workflows
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   └── test/
├── docs/
├── k8s/                    # Kubernetes manifests
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### 2. Branch Protection Configuration

#### Main Branch Protection:
- [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging
- [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [ ] Require conversation resolution before merging
- [ ] Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB

#### Development Workflow:
- [ ] Set up `main` branch as default protected branch
- [ ] Create `develop` branch for ongoing development
- [ ] Configure feature branch naming convention: `feature/TICKET-short-description`
- [ ] Configure release branch naming: `release/v1.x.x`

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration:

**Build and Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-test.yml`):
```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:13
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Cache Maven packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.m2
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
        
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn clean test
      
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: mvn clean verify
      
    - name: Generate test report
      uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
      if: success() || failure()
      with:
        name: Maven Tests
        path: target/surefire-reports/*.xml
        reporter: java-junit
```

**Security Scan Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):
```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
      uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### 4. Quality Gates and Standards

#### Code Quality Requirements:
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] No duplicated code blocks > 10 lines
- [ ] Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 10
- [ ] All public methods must have JavaDoc

#### Pull Request Requirements:
- [ ] All tests must pass
- [ ] Code coverage must not decrease
- [ ] Security scan must pass
- [ ] At least one approved review required
- [ ] No unresolved conversations

### 5. Environment Configuration

#### Environment Setup:
- [ ] Development environment configuration
- [ ] Staging environment configuration  
- [ ] Production environment configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific secrets management

#### Required Secrets:
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- [ ] `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Firebase configuration
- [ ] `SNYK_TOKEN` - Security scanning token

### 6. Documentation Updates

#### Required Documentation:
- [ ] Update main README.md with GitHub-specific information
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- [ ] Update API documentation links to point to GitHub Pages

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Branch protection rules implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working and green
- [ ] Security scanning configured
- [ ] All environments properly configured
- [ ] Documentation updated for GitHub workflow
- [ ] First successful deployment completed

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Immediate Actions:
1. [ ] Notify team of new repository location
2. [ ] Update any external references to the old repository
3. [ ] Archive or redirect old repository if applicable
4. [ ] Update deployment scripts to point to new repository

### Ongoing Maintenance:
1. [ ] Monitor CI/CD pipeline health
2. [ ] Regular security scan reviews
3. [ ] Dependency updates and vulnerability patching
4. [ ] Performance monitoring setup

## Timeline Estimate

**Phase 5 Duration:** 1 day (8 hours)

- Repository Setup: 2 hours
- CI/CD Configuration: 3 hours  
- Security and Quality Gates: 2 hours
- Testing and Validation: 1 hour
