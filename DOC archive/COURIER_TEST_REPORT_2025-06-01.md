## 🔧 Required Fixes Before Testing

### Priority 1: Fix Compilation Errors
1. **commission-service**:
   - Add missing dependencies to pom.xml
   - Fix OpenFeign and OpenAPI imports

2. **courier-management**:
   - Fix package declarations in model classes
   - Ensure proper Java file structure

### Priority 2: Add Missing Test Files
- Create unit tests for services without test coverage
- Implement integration tests for service communication

## 📈 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix compilation errors** in commission-service and courier-management
2. **Verify build success** with `mvn clean compile`
3. **Run tests** only after successful compilation

### Test Strategy:
1. Start with services that have existing tests
2. Focus on unit tests first, then integration tests
3. Add test coverage for services without tests

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix the compilation issues identified above
2. Re-run `mvn clean compile` to verify fixes
3. Execute `mvn test` for individual services
4. Generate detailed test coverage report

## 📝 Notes

- The parent POM has been fixed to use Spring Boot parent
- Services are configured for Spring Boot 3.1.1 and Java 17
- Test dependencies are properly configured in POMs
- Test execution blocked by compilation errors
