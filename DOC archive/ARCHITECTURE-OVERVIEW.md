# Courier Services Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Courier Services Architecture is a comprehensive system for managing courier operations at global, regional, and local levels. It follows a hierarchical structure that enables centralized governance while allowing for regional customization and local operational management.

## Key Components

### 1. Global HQ Admin Dashboard

**Purpose:** Central management and governance of the entire courier network.

**Key Features:**
- Global settings management
- Admin user management with role-based access control
- Regional management with global oversight
- Service configuration standardization
- Global performance metrics and KPI tracking
- Pricing strategy management

**Components Implemented:**
- Model layer with core entities
- Repository layer for data access
- Service layer with business logic
- Controller layer with RESTful APIs
- Configuration settings

### 2. Regional Admin System

**Purpose:** Management of regional courier operations, bridging global governance with local execution.

**Key Features:**
- Regional settings customization
- Regional admin user management
- Courier location management within region
- Service configuration adaptation to regional needs
- Regional performance tracking

**Components Implemented:**
- Model entities for regional management
- Repository interfaces for data operations
- Service implementations with business rules
- REST controllers for API access
- Configuration for regional autonomy

### 3. Courier Network Locations (Local Level)

**Purpose:** Physical facilities where actual courier operations take place.

**Key Features:**
- Local courier staff management
- Package processing
- Inventory management
- Customer drop-off/pick-up operations
- Last-mile delivery coordination

**Implementation Status:**
- Data model designed
- API endpoints for location management defined
- Integration with regional systems planned

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture

Each component follows a clear layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer:** REST APIs
- **Service Layer:** Business logic
- **Repository Layer:** Data access
- **Domain Layer:** Core entities

### 2. Microservices Approach

The system is designed as a set of loosely coupled microservices:
- Each major component runs as a separate service
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- Service discovery and registration enabled

### 3. Domain-Driven Design

- Bounded contexts for each major component
- Clear domain models with rich business semantics
- Focus on the ubiquitous language of courier services

## Technical Stack

- **Language:** Java 11
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 2.5+
- **API:** RESTful with Spring MVC
- **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka
- **Configuration:** Spring Cloud Config
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Security:** OAuth2, JWT

## Integration Points

### External Integrations:
- Authentication/Authorization services
- Payment processing
- Mapping and geolocation services
- Notification services (email, SMS)

### Internal Integrations:
- Global HQ ⟷ Regional Admin Systems
- Regional Admin Systems ⟷ Local Courier Locations
- Cross-regional coordination for package transfers

## Deployment Considerations

- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Environment-specific configurations
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure

## Future Expansion

1. **Mobile Applications:**
   - Courier driver mobile app
   - Customer package tracking app

2. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Predictive delivery time estimation
   - Route optimization
   - Resource allocation forecasting

3. **Automation:**
   - Automated sorting systems integration
   - Robotics warehouse management
   - Drone delivery support

## Conclusion

The Courier Services Architecture provides a scalable, flexible foundation for managing courier operations across global, regional, and local levels. The hierarchical structure enables effective governance while accommodating regional variations and local operational needs.
