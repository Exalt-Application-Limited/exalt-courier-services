# Frontend Applications Transformation - Week 5 Complete

## Summary
Successfully continued and completed the Week 5 Frontend Applications transformation for the courier services domain.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed Frontend Application Build Scripts

- Added build scripts to `driver-mobile-app` (Node.js/Webpack)  
- Added build scripts to `user-mobile-app` (React Native)

### 2. ✅ Set Up Development Environments
- Created Android/iOS directory structures for React Native apps
- Added entry points (index.js, App.js, app.json) for mobile apps
- Created webpack configuration for driver-mobile-app backend
- Added .env.example templates

### 3. ✅ Created Deployment Configurations
- Docker Compose configuration for all frontend services
- Individual Dockerfiles for each application
- Nginx configurations for React web applications
- Proper networking between frontend and backend services
