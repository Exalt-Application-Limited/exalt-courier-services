# Courier Availability Service Transformation Plan
**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## Service Overview

The Courier Availability service is responsible for determining which couriers are available in a given area at a specific time, considering factors such as:
- Geographic coverage
- Current workload
- Service level availability
- Time of day constraints
- Special delivery capabilities

## Transformation Goals

1. **Modernize Architecture**
   - Move from monolithic design to microservice architecture
   - Improve scalability for peak demand periods

2. **Enhance Performance**
   - Reduce average response time from 250ms to <100ms
   - Support 3x current peak load capacity

3. **Extend Functionality**
   - Add real-time courier tracking integration
   - Implement dynamic availability prediction based on traffic patterns
   - Support priority-based courier allocation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- [ ] Create new service repository with same API contract
- [ ] Implement core domain model using DDD principles
- [ ] Set up feature flag integration
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics collection

### Phase 2: Feature Parity (Weeks 2-3)

- [ ] Implement all existing endpoints with equivalent functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, business workflow)
- [ ] Verify API compatibility with existing consumers
- [ ] Deploy alongside existing service with 0% traffic

### Phase 3: Graduated Rollout (Weeks 4-5)

- [ ] Enable shadow mode testing in production
- [ ] Analyze cross-version test results for behavior equivalence
- [ ] Begin graduated rollout following schedule:
  - Day 1: 5% internal traffic
  - Day 3: 20% general traffic
  - Day 7: 50% general traffic
  - Day 14: 100% traffic

### Phase 4: Enhancement (Weeks 6-8)

- [ ] Implement new features after successful migration
- [ ] Monitor performance improvements
- [ ] Document architectural changes

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Performance regression | Cross-version testing with performance thresholds |
| Inconsistent behavior | Extensive business workflow validation |
| Data synchronization issues | Shadow mode testing in production |
| Service dependency failures | Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms |

## Technical Implementation

### Old vs. New Architecture

**Current Implementation:**
- Node.js Express service with MongoDB
- Synchronous calls to other services
- In-memory caching for availability data

**New Implementation:**
- Node.js with TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB
- Event-driven architecture for courier status updates
- Redis-based distributed caching
- CircuitBreaker pattern for resilience
- Repository pattern for data access

### Key Monitoring Metrics

1. **Performance**
   - Request latency (p50, p90, p99)
   - Throughput (requests per second)
   - Error rate percentage

2. **Business**
   - Courier assignment success rate
   - Availability prediction accuracy
   - Geographic coverage percentage

3. **System**
   - Cache hit ratio
   - Database query performance
   - Event processing latency

## Rollback Plan

If metrics exceed thresholds during rollout:

1. Feature flag system automatically reverts to old implementation
2. Engineering team receives alert via Slack and PagerDuty
3. Incident response team analyzes logs and metrics
4. Issues are addressed in the new implementation
5. Rollout process restarts from 0%

## Success Criteria

The transformation will be considered successful when:

1. New implementation handles 100% of traffic for 7+ days
2. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
3. No functional regressions detected
4. All new features successfully implemented
5. Old implementation can be safely decommissioned

## Post-Transformation Review

Two weeks after reaching 100% traffic, conduct a review to:
- Document lessons learned
- Refine transformation process for next service
- Identify technical debt to address
- Celebrate success with the team!
